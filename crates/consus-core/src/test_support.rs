//! Assertions that name the constraint a call violated.
//!
//! An assertion that only checks a result is an error passes whenever the call
//! fails, including for a reason unrelated to the one the test exists to
//! catch. The helpers here assert the rendered error instead, so a test fails
//! when the code rejects its input for the wrong reason.
//!
//! [`Error`](crate::Error) renders as `category: message`, so a fragment that
//! spans the colon pins the variant as well as the cause: swapping
//! `ShapeError` for `InvalidFormat` changes the rendered prefix and the
//! assertion fails.
